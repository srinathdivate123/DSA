// You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to find and return its square root. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value of sqrt(n).

// Note: The question explicitly states that if the given number, n, is not a perfect square, our objective is to find the maximum number, x, such that x squared is less than or equal to n (x*x <= n). In other words, we need to determine the floor value of the square root of n.
